This research investigates the influence of demographic factors on facial recognition algorithms and proposes strategies to enhance accuracy and fairness. Four prominent face recognition algorithms (LBP, EigenFace, FaceNet, and Face_recognition) undergo systematic evaluation across diverse demographic cohorts, encompassing race, gender, and age. Additionally, strategic data augmentation techniques are employed to address potential biases in algorithm performance.

Analysis of the UTKface dataset uncovers significant variations in algorithm accuracy across demographic cohorts. FaceNet achieves exemplary accuracy across all cohorts, while Face_recognition exhibits comparatively lower accuracy, particularly for White, Male, and Female cohorts. The initial application of ordinary data augmentation yields an overall improvement in accuracy, but certain cohorts experience a decrease, necessitating the use of strategic augmentation.

Strategic augmentation introduces variations in pose, colour, and orientation to tackle recognition challenges faced by specific cohorts. Re-evaluation after strategic augmentation showcases substantial accuracy improvements for affected cohorts. Notably, accuracy for Old-white-male increases from 65% to 95.00%, Indian accuracy rises from 87% to 94.00%, and Black accuracy improves from 98% to 100.00%. This highlights the profound impact of demographic factors on face recognition performance and underscores the importance of adopting strategic data augmentation to enhance algorithm fairness. 

In conclusion, this research provides valuable insights into facial recognition algorithm performance across demographic cohorts. The strategic use of data augmentation offers a promising avenue to enhance fairness and accuracy in facial recognition systems. By prioritizing algorithmic fairness and ethical considerations, researchers and developers can contribute to the advancement of equitable and unbiased facial recognition technology.

This study employed an experimental design to investigate the influence of demographic factors on face recognition system performance and the efficacy of data augmentation in mitigating their impact. The research focused on evaluating the performance of four distinct algorithms (LBP, EigenFace, FaceNet, and Face_recognition) across diverse demographic cohorts.

, during the initial stage, individuals within the dataset were categorized based on their race (Black, Indian, Asian, White), gender (Male, Female), and age groups (Young, Mid_age, Old). Age groups were categorized as Young (18 to 30 years), Mid_age (31 to 50 years), and Old (51 years and above).This was followed by algorithm evaluation. The primary objective of the initial evaluation was to identify the algorithm that demonstrated superior performance across the demographic cohorts. Consequently, the algorithm exhibiting the highest accuracy within the demographic cohorts was selected for further analysis. This selection was based on its ability to accurately recognize faces across various races, genders, and age groups. The algorithm are expected to give accurate result in this stage since the same image used for training is the one used for evaluation. 
Subsequently, a subset of images was chosen from each demographic cohort and underwent augmentation techniques to expand the available dataset for each individual within the cohorts. The purpose of this augmentation was solely to increase the dataset size, as the selected algorithm relies on a substantial dataset for effective training. However, it is important to note that the augmentation performed in this stage lacked strategic considerations to mitigate the impact of pose, color variations, and aging, as identified by previous researchers. The purpose of this stage was to investigate the influence of demographic factors on the algorithm's performance, and the selected images were re-evaluated to determine their individual accuracy. The evaluation was based on accuracy and visual inspection.
To address the limitations identified in the previous stage and account for the effects of pose, color, illumination, and aging, the images of individuals that exhibited poor performance were firstly re-evaluated individually to know each cohortâ€™s accuracy on the algorithm before they underwent strategic augmentation using specific techniques. 
The following techniques were applied to optimize the performance of the face recognition system:
Random Rotation: This transformation randomly rotates the image by a larger degree (up to 30 degrees in this case) compared to Augmentation 1. This provides more diverse variations in pose during training.
Random Horizontal Flip: This augmentation flips the image horizontally with a 50% chance. It allows the model to generalize better to horizontally flipped faces, which can appear in real-world scenarios.
Random Vertical Flip: Similarly to the horizontal flip, this augmentation flips the image vertically with a 50% chance. It helps the model learn from vertically flipped faces if present in the dataset.
Color Jitter: This applies random changes to the color of the image, but with slightly larger variations (brightness up to 0.2, contrast up to 0.2, saturation up to 0.2, and hue up to 0.1).
Random Resized Crop: This step resizes the image to a random size and then crops a random region from the image at the specified size (224x224 in this case).
To Tensor: This transformation converts the image to a tensor for use in deep learning frameworks.
This augmentation introduces more substantial random rotations (up to 30 degrees) and includes random horizontal and vertical flips. Additionally, it applies slightly larger variations in color jitter. These adjustments result in increased diversity during training, which can help the model become more robust to various transformations and real-world scenarios.
